Claddis is an in-development R package designed to import cladistic-type data sets (#NEXUS format) into R and perform disparity and rate tests.

Below are links to slides from two conference presentations on the package. (Note: the package has changed a lot since these were given!)

[Talk 1](http://www.slideshare.net/graemelloyd/a-new-r-package-for-automating-cladistic-ordination-and-the-effects-of-phylogenetic-signal-on-disparity-measures)

[Talk 2](http://www.slideshare.net/graemelloyd/claddis-a-new-r-package-for-automating-disparity-analyses-based-on-cladistic-datasets)

You can install and load Claddis into R using the following:

```r
# Install the devtools package from CRAN:
install.packages("devtools")

# Load the devtools package into R:
library(devtools)

# Install the Claddis package from github:
install_github("graemetlloyd/Claddis")

# Load the Claddis package into R:
library(Claddis)
```

More will be added here in future to show the basic features of the package.
